# Brand Checklist (Public Site)

Use this before merging UI/copy changes in `app/(site)` and `components/site`.

1. Palette hierarchy is respected:
- Cream for page space
- Green for environment blocks
- Burgundy for primary actions

2. CTA hierarchy is correct:
- One primary CTA per section uses burgundy
- Secondary actions use green or outline styles

3. Tokenized colors are used:
- No ad-hoc hex colors in public site files unless explicitly approved

4. Dark sections use on-dark tokens:
- Primary text: `--site-on-dark-primary`
- Muted text: `--site-on-dark-muted`

5. Typography hierarchy is intact:
- Headings use serif display style
- Body/UI text stays readable and restrained

6. Tone of voice is aligned:
- Calm, specific, grounded
- No hype, no generic startup language
- No exclamation marks, no em dashes, no rhetorical questions
- Contains at least one concrete sensory/detail anchor

7. Visual states are complete:
- CTA hover states match brand palette
- Focus/active states remain visible

8. Imagery fits brand direction:
- Observational and grounded, not staged marketing shots
- Mix follows target ratio (environment/running/connection/texture)
- No fitness/race/gym/influencer/corporate-retreat visual language
- Color grading stays warm-neutral and restrained
