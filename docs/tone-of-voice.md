# Miles Between Tone of Voice

A guide for anyone writing on behalf of Miles Between.

## The Brand Belief
Running is one of the few things left that genuinely clears your head. Not because it is hard, and not because of the miles logged or times posted, but because for a while you are just a person moving through a landscape with nothing else competing for your attention.

Running also connects people quickly. Two runners who have never met usually understand each other within minutes. Shared effort removes a lot of noise.

Miles Between exists to protect both of those things: the quiet space running creates, and the connection that follows it. A few days built around movement, conversation, and time outside the pace of normal life.

## Who We Are Writing For
People who run regularly enough that it is part of their life.

- Some run once or twice a week.
- Some run four or five times and race occasionally.
- The common thread is not volume. It is that running helps them think, reset, and feel like themselves.

They have full lives. Careers, families, relationships, responsibilities. Running sits alongside those things, not above them.

They are allergic to wellness-speak. They are thoughtful, quality-aware, and not interested in being sold to with inflated language.

Running is part of their identity, not all of it.

## What They Leave With
Not transformation. Something quieter and more durable.

- Mental clarity
- Perspective
- Connection

These outcomes should be felt in the writing even when not stated explicitly.

## Voice Principles

### 1) Earned confidence
Write like someone who knows because they have done it.

- Avoid: aspirational vagueness, superlatives, trying to sound premium
- Aim for: plain, quiet authority

### 2) Specificity over atmosphere
One concrete detail beats three lines of mood.

- Avoid: breathtaking, considered, restored, elevated, curated, immersive
- Aim for: the single detail the reader can see or feel

### 3) Warmth without softness
Friendly, direct, respectful. Never effusive.

- Avoid: exclamation marks, rhetorical flourish, praise-seeking tone
- Aim for: a well-written note from someone you trust

### 4) A point of view
The brand has opinions and does not sound generic.

- Avoid: neutral language that could belong to any retreat brand
- Aim for: copy that could only be Miles Between

### 5) Restraint
Say less than you are tempted to.

- Avoid: padding, repetition, adjective stacking
- Aim for: every sentence earning its place

### 6) Quiet persuasion
No pressure tactics, but clear desire and clear choice.

- Avoid: hard sell, urgency manipulation
- Aim for: the decision feeling obvious, not manufactured

## Voice by Context

### Retreat pages
Most expressive voice: detail, atmosphere, quiet persuasion.

### Booking and transactional copy
More direct and practical. Clarity first.

### Email
Personal and slightly more casual, still restrained.

### Social
Short register. One or two lines. No hashtags. No forced CTA.

## Grammar and Style Rules
- Prefer second person (`you`) and sparse first-person plural (`we`).
- Short sentences are acceptable. Fragments are acceptable when intentional.
- No exclamation marks.
- No em dashes.
- No rhetorical questions.
- Avoid: journey, curated, elevated, immersive, bespoke, boutique, transformative.
- Prefer numbers and specifics (for example `12 guests`, `three nights`).

## The Test Before Publishing
1. Could this have been written by any retreat brand?
2. Is there at least one concrete detail?
3. Does it sound like a person wrote it?

If any answer fails, rewrite.

## Reference Points
Voice references:
- Early Kinfolk
- Patagonia long-form
- Aesop product copy
- Craig Mod walking essays
- The menu at St John, London

Not this voice:
- Lululemon manifesto style
- Wellness Instagram tone
- Adventure tourism brochure language
- Any copy relying on the word transformative
